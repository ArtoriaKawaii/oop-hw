Define a class named zipCode, that decrypts and encrypts zip code.

Here's encoding rule:
    For every code, it has 25 binary bit and divides into 5 group.
    Each group has 5 digits. For each group, There always will be exactly two 1's in each group of digits.
    Each digit stands for a number. From left to right,the digits encode the values 7, 4, 2, 1, and 0.
    Multiply the corresponding value with the digit and compute the sum to get the final encoded digit for the zip code. 

The following table shows the encoding for 10100:

Digits:  1 0 1 0 0

Value:   7 4 2 1 0

product: 7 0 2 0 0

zip code digit = 7 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 9

Repeat this for each group of five digits and concatenate to get the complete zip code.
There is one special value.
if Sum of a group of five digits is 11. then this represents the digit 0
(this is necessary because with two digits per group it is not possible to represents zero).

For example: 10100 10100 01010 11000 01001 deocdes to 99504

Rule:

The class must has two constructors.

The first one should input the zip code as an interger, the second one should input the zip code as a string consisting 0's and 1's as described above.

The class must store the zip code, either in string (10100 ...) or in integer (99504).

The class should have at least two pulic member function, one to return zip code as integer (decrypt) , and another one returns zip code as string(encrypt).

Inputs:

The first line input gives the number of cases n,Then it following a group of input data.
It contains two line. First one decides to encrypt or to decrypt.
'e' represents encrypting, 'd' represents decrypting.
The second line consist data that have to decrypt or encrypt.

Outputs:

The result of encrypting or decrypting.

Example:

Input:

2

e

99504

d

10100 10100 01010 11000 01001

Output:

10100 10100 01010 11000 01001

99504

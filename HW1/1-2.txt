 The Babylonian algorithm to compute the square root of a positive number N is as follows:

     1. Make a GUESS at the answer (you can pick N/2 as your initial guess).

     2. Computer R = N / GUESS.

     3. Set GUESS = (GUESS + R) / 2.

     4. Go back to step 2 for as many iterations as necessary. The more steps 2 and 3 are repeated, the closer GUESS wIll become to the square root of N.


    Write a program that inputs an integer for N, iterates through the Babylonian algorithm five times, and outputs the answer as an integer.


Your answer will be most accurate for small values of N.

Write a function named getHighScore that takes a string reference parameter and an integer reference parameter.
The function should scan through the input and set the reference parameters to the name of the player with the highest score and the corresponding score.

The program should input the number of the players, followed by the players’ name and their scores.
Your output are the name and the score of player whose score is the highest, and output ‘-1’ if there is something wrong with input.
If you don’t answer with the function, you won’t get the score for this homework.

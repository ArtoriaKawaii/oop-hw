Write a program that reads letters and stored in an array, Then it determines how many vowels in the array.
The output is to be a two-column list.
The first column is a list of vowels in the English alphabet; the second column is the count of the number of occurrences of each vowel.
The list should be sorted on the order of ascii code.

You may assume that input are fewer than 50 letters , and input letters may include capital alphabet, space and punctuation.

You MUST use array in this program, or you will get 0.

The problem contains only one input.

example:

input:

output:

a 3

e 2

i 2

o 2
